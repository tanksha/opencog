  psi-rule CONTEXT ACTION GOAL TV DEMAND - create a psi-rule.

  Associate an action with a context such that, if the action is
  taken, then the goal will be satisfied.  The structure of a rule
  is in the form of an `ImplicationLink`,

    (ImplicationLink TV
        (AndLink
            CONTEXT
            ACTION)
        GOAL)

  where:
  CONTEXT is a scheme list containing all of the terms that should
    be met for the ACTION to be taken. These are atoms that, when
    evaluated, should result in a true or false TV.

  ACTION is an evaluatable atom, i.e. returns a TV when evaluated by
    `cog-evaluate!`.  It should return a true or false TV.

  GOAL is an evaluatable atom, i.e. returns a TV when evaluated by
    `cog-evaluate!`.  The returned TV is used as a formula to rank
    how this rule affects the demands.

  TV is the TruthValue assigned to the ImplicationLink. It should
    be a SimpleTruthValue.

  DEMAND is a Node, representing the demand that this rule affects.
