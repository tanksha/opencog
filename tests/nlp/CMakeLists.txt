# Disable sureal and microplanning - Jan 2020
# These two modules have not been used in many years, and are unmaintained.
# Recent changes to the pattern matcher have exposed bugs in
# nlp/sureal/SuRealPMCB.cc that are not readily apparent.  I don't want
# to maintain the code that no one else wants to maintain, either, so
# I'm just going to stub this out, and let future generations find and
# fix the bug(s). My general guess is that sureal probably should NOT
# be using a customized pattern matcher, anyway; just use what's
# provided, instead of inventing something oddly different.
